Description: R has a unique way of dealing with warnings, errors, messages, 
    and other conditions, but it can often be troublesome to users coming 
    from different programming backgrounds. The purpose of this package is 
    to provide flexible and useful tools for handling R conditions with 
    less hassle. In order to lower the barrier of entry, keep code clean 
    and readable, and reduce the amount of typing required, `catchr` uses 
    a very simple domain-specific language that simplifies things on the 
    front-end. 
    This package aims to maintain a continuous learning curve that lets new 
    users jump straight in to condition-handling, while simultaneously 
    offering depth and complexity for more advanced users.
