is_catchr_plan(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object to test}
}
\description{
Currently, this function just checks whether a list was made via
\code{\link[=make_plans]{make_plans()}}. It does so simply by looking at the class of the list. \cr \cr
In the future, \code{catchr} plans may become more complicated (i.e., to avoid the
horrible printing) and this will become a more useful API
