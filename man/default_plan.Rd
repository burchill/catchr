\title{Get/set the input for the default catchr plan}
\usage{
set_default_plan(new_plan)

get_default_plan()
}
\arguments{
\item{new_plan}{The input (in the style of named arguments to \code{\link{make_plans}}) that will become the input of default plan.}
}
\value{
\code{set_default_plan()} will invisibly return a "cleaned up" version of the input (i.e., evaluated, and with the unquoted terms replaced with strings), which is what will also be returned by \code{get_default_plan()} until a new default is set.
}
\description{
These functions allow the user to set and retrieve the input that will be assigned to any conditions passed to \code{\link[=make_plans]{make_plans()}} without plans (i.e., as unnamed arguments). Using the same inputting style as \code{make_plans}, the argument \code{new_plan} will essentially be treated the same way a single named argument would be in \code{make_plans()}, without actually having a name/specific condition.
