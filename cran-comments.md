## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the README.md headers from setext-style headers to ATX-style headers,
	presumably this was why Debian couldn't find the title in my .md file

I have ignored the 'checking CRAN incoming feasibility' NOTE as instructed here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23829978/checking-cran-incoming-feasibility-note-maintainer

* Fedora 28, R 3.5.1
* win-builder (devel and release)
